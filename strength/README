strength.inc
------------
assess password strength. Returns 0.0 (very strong) to 1.0 (very weak)

algorithm
---------
4 classes (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and symbols) are expected
to have 1/4 distribution each (0.25). The deviation is calculated and the square root of
the sum of the squares is taken.

Consecutive identical characters also decrease the strength, as do the number of consecutive identical
character groups. The numbers are calculated as follows:
   d_sequence = longest sequence / actual length;
   d_groups = (number of sequantial groups * 2.0) / actual length;
These numbers are added to the square root of the sum of the squares.

The strength is decreased if the length of the password is below the minimum:
   log(mimimum length / actual length)
This is added to the square root of the sum of the squares.

The strength is increased if it is longer (until maximum). The contribution is linear and proportional
to the contributing factor (default 50% of the calculated weakness).

The algorithm may result in weakness values slightly larger than 1.0. As these are irrelevant, they
are reduced to 1.0

In addition to the password, the following defaults may be modified in the call:


$minimum = 8          minimum password length (if shorter, the weakness increases strongly).
$maximum = 20         maximum contributing number of extra characters in longer passwords
$contributing = 50    percentage contributing factor for longer passwords

e.g   strength("B0cKBiE4")     yields 0.353553390593 (strong)
      strength("B0cKBiE4", 10) yields 0.418082580949 (medium)

i.e. the strength is dependent on the expected password length

bugs
----
Only single character repeats are detected. e.g.

aZ-0 has a value of 0.69314718056
aZ-0aZ-0 has a value of 0 but should be at least 0.1 ~ 0.2
