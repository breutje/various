# Unfortunately, my car stereo does not play itunes m4a files, only mp3 CD-ROMs.
# lame solution: convert mp4/aac to mp3 ;-). There is some loss as we re-encode
# AAC to MPEG Layer III audio, but using a good encoder with reasonable settings
# the output is acceptable (i.e. I cannot hear the difference). It does not copy
# the lyrics, but my car stereo can't display them anyway....

# Requirements: mplayer, AtomicParsley, mp3unicode, eyeD3 and Lame
